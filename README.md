# Drowsiness-Detection

Drowsiness Detection System
A computer vision–based model that detects driver drowsiness in real time and plays a buzzer alert to help prevent accidents caused by fatigue.

Over 50,000 car accidents occur annually due to drowsy driving, and this project aims to tackle that problem using AI-powered detection and an instant alert mechanism.

# Features
-Real-time face and eye detection using a webcam or video feed.

-Buzzer alert when eye closure is detected.

-Lightweight and easy to run on most systems.

# Tech Stack
Python

-OpenCV – for image processing and video capture.

-TensorFlow and PyTorch.

-YOLO

-Pygame  – for buzzer alert.

# How It Works
Capture live video feed through a webcam.

Detect facial landmarks to locate the eyes.

Compute the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR).

If EAR stays below a threshold for a set duration, trigger a buzzer to alert the user.
